# Phase 1: Economic Engine - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

Phase 1 of the Aggressive Bot Roadmap has been successfully implemented. All files integrate with the existing TooAngel architecture.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/brain_economy.js` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Centralized economic monitoring and decision-making system

**Key Functions**:
- `getEconomicStatus(room)` - Returns status: DEVELOPING, EMERGENCY, CRITICAL, LOW, HEALTHY, WEALTHY, ABUNDANT
- `calculateIncomeRate(room)` - Calculates energy/tick income over 100-tick windows
- `canSupportExpansion(room)` - Returns true if room is HEALTHY+ and meeting income targets
- `canSupportMilitary(room)` - Returns true if room is WEALTHY+ (100k+ energy)
- `getUpgraderTarget(room)` - Smart upgrader scaling (0-15 work parts based on economy)
- `brain.evaluateEconomy()` - Main function called every tick, updates all room economics

**Data Storage**:
- `room.data.economy` (heap) - Fast access for current tick
- `Memory.economyStats[roomName]` - Historical tracking

**Integration Points**:
- Called from `brain_main.js` execute() function
- Used by `role_upgrader.js` for dynamic scaling
- Used by `prototype_room_my.js` for link efficiency

---

## Files Modified

### 2. `/src/config.js`
**Changes**:
- Added `debug.economy: false` - Enable/disable economy logging
- Added `economy` section:
  ```javascript
  economy: {
    enabled: true,
    targetReserves: 50000,      // Target storage before expansion
    wealthyThreshold: 100000,   // Enable military operations
    emergencyThreshold: 10000,  // Survival mode
    upgraderFactor: 2,          // Energy per WORK part
    maxUpgraders: 15,           // Cap upgrader count
  }
  ```

### 3. `/src/require.js`
**Changes**:
- Added `require('./brain_economy');` after brain_main
- Ensures module is loaded before use

### 4. `/src/brain_main.js`
**Changes**:
- Added economy evaluation in execute() function:
  ```javascript
  if (config.economy.enabled) {
    brain.evaluateEconomy();
  }
  ```
- Runs after `prepareMemory()`, before other brain functions

### 5. `/src/role_upgrader.js`
**Changes**:
- Modified `updateSettings()` to use economy brain
- Falls back to original logic if economy system disabled
- Now scales upgraders based on economic status:
  - EMERGENCY/CRITICAL: 0-1 upgraders (survival mode)
  - LOW: 1 upgrader (minimal upgrading)
  - HEALTHY: Scales based on excess energy
  - WEALTHY/ABUNDANT: Up to 15 upgraders
  - RCL 8: Special handling (only upgrade when ABUNDANT)

### 6. `/src/prototype_room_my.js`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced `handleLinks()` function:
  - Checks economy status before transferring energy
  - Stops link transfers during CRITICAL/EMERGENCY economy
  - Filters links to only transfer those with >400 energy
  - Prioritizes source links (positions 1 & 2) over other links
  - More efficient energy distribution

## How It Works

### Execution Flow
```
main.js
  â””â”€> brain_main.execute()
      â””â”€> brain.evaluateEconomy()  [NEW]
          â””â”€> For each room:
              â”œâ”€> Calculate status (EMERGENCY â†’ ABUNDANT)
              â”œâ”€> Calculate income rate (energy/tick)
              â”œâ”€> Determine if can expand
              â”œâ”€> Determine if can fight
              â”œâ”€> Calculate optimal upgrader count
              â””â”€> Store in room.data.economy & Memory.economyStats
```

### Room Status Thresholds
```
EMERGENCY:  0-10k energy    (Spawn only critical roles)
CRITICAL:   10k-30k energy  (Conservative operations)
LOW:        30k-50k energy  (Normal operations)
HEALTHY:    50k-100k energy (Can expand to new rooms)
WEALTHY:    100k-200k energy (Can support military)
ABUNDANT:   200k+ energy    (Maximum aggression)
```

### Upgrader Scaling Example
```
Storage Energy | Status   | Upgraders
---------------|----------|----------
5,000         | EMERGENCY| 0
15,000        | CRITICAL | 1
40,000        | LOW      | 1
60,000        | HEALTHY  | 3
120,000       | WEALTHY  | 7
250,000       | ABUNDANT | 15 (max)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Deploy to server** (private or public)
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   # or
   npm run deployLocal
   ```

2. **Enable economy debug logging**
   - Edit `src/config.js`
   - Set `debug.economy: true`
   - Redeploy

3. **Monitor console output**
   ```
   [Economy] E1S1: HEALTHY | Income: 12.5/tick | Expand: true | Military: false
   ```

4. **Check Memory**
   - In game console: `Memory.economyStats`
   - Should show per-room stats with timestamp

5. **Verify upgrader scaling**
   - Watch upgrader count change as storage fills/empties
   - Set `debug.upgrader: true` for detailed logs

6. **Test link efficiency**
   - Observe source links transferring to storage link
   - Verify transfers stop when economy is CRITICAL

### Expected Behavior:

âœ… **Economy tracking runs every tick without errors**
- Check console for no "Brain Exception" errors

âœ… **Upgraders scale dynamically**
- Low energy â†’ fewer upgraders
- High energy â†’ more upgraders (up to 15)

âœ… **Links prioritize source links**
- Source links (positions 1, 2) transfer before others

âœ… **Links respect economy status**
- Transfers stop when room is CRITICAL/EMERGENCY

âœ… **CPU impact is minimal**
- Economy brain should use <0.5 CPU per room

âœ… **Memory usage is reasonable**
- `Memory.economyStats` should be small (<1KB per room)

---

## Success Metrics (Phase 1)

Track these over 10k ticks:

### Economic Stability
- âœ… Storage reaches and maintains 50k+ energy in RCL 5+ rooms
- âœ… Income rate meets targets for room RCL
- âœ… No energy waste (carriers not dropping, upgraders not starving)

### Upgrader Efficiency
- âœ… Upgraders scale down when storage <30k
- âœ… Upgraders scale up when storage >50k
- âœ… Maximum 15 upgraders active simultaneously

### Link Efficiency
- âœ… Source links transfer >80% uptime
- âœ… Storage link receives energy consistently
- âœ… Links stop transferring during economic crisis

### System Performance
- âœ… No script errors in console
- âœ… Economy brain CPU usage <0.5 per room
- âœ… Memory usage stable (no growth over time)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Brain Exception" errors
**Solution**: Check that brain_economy.js is loaded via require.js

### Issue: room.data.economy is undefined
**Solution**: Economy brain might not be running. Check `config.economy.enabled = true`

### Issue: Upgraders not scaling
**Solution**:
1. Check `config.debug.upgrader: true` to see logs
2. Verify room has storage
3. Check that economy data exists: `Game.rooms['ROOMNAME'].data.economy`

### Issue: Links not working
**Solution**:
1. Ensure room has RCL 5+ (links unlock at RCL 5)
2. Check `room.memory.position.structure.link` exists
3. Verify source links at positions [1] and [2]

### Issue: High CPU usage
**Solution**:
1. Economy brain should be <0.5 CPU per room
2. If higher, check for rooms without storage (causes recalculation every tick)

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete! You can now:

### Option A: Test Phase 1 Thoroughly
- Deploy to server
- Run for 20k ticks
- Monitor metrics
- Tune thresholds in config.js if needed

### Option B: Proceed to Phase 2
- **Phase 2: Expansion Automation**
- Implements aggressive room claiming
- Uses economy brain's `canSupportExpansion()`
- Room scoring and prioritization
- Remote mining assignments

### How to Enable Debug Logging
```javascript
// In src/config.js
debug: {
  economy: true,    // See economy status
  upgrader: true,   // See upgrader scaling
  nextroomer: true, // See expansion logic (Phase 2)
}
```

## Code Quality Notes

âœ… **Follows TooAngel conventions**
- Uses `debugLog()` from logging.js
- Stores data in `room.data` (heap) and `Memory`
- JSDoc comments on all functions
- Matches existing code style

âœ… **Backward compatible**
- Falls back to original logic if economy disabled
- Doesn't break existing functionality
- Can be toggled via config

âœ… **Performance optimized**
- Calculations cached for 100 ticks
- Uses heap storage for fast access
- Minimal Memory writes

âœ… **Maintainable**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented thresholds
- Easy to tune via config

## Phase 1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The economic foundation is now in place. Your bot will:
