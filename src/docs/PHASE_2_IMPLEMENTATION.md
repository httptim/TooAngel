# Phase 2: Expansion Automation - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

Phase 2 of the Aggressive Bot Roadmap has been successfully implemented. Your bot will now aggressively claim new rooms and establish remote mining operations.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/brain_remote_mining.js` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Manages remote resource extraction from neutral and SK rooms

**Key Functions**:
- `findRemoteMiningTargets(baseRoom, maxDistance)` - Scores and ranks nearby rooms for mining
- `brain.manageRemoteMining()` - Assigns 2-3 remote rooms to each base (runs every 1000 ticks)

**Scoring System**:
```
Score = (sources * 1000) - (distance * 100)
```

**Remote Room Criteria**:
- ❌ Not claimed/occupied
- ❌ Not already owned by you
- ✅ Has sources
- ✅ Within 3 rooms distance
- ✅ Economy status HEALTHY or better

**Data Storage**:
- `Memory.remoteMining[baseRoom] = [remoteRoom1, remoteRoom2, ...]`

---

## Files Modified

### 2. `/src/brain_nextroom.js` (ENHANCED)
**Major Changes**:

#### A) New Advanced Room Scoring
Replaced simple mineral+distance scoring with comprehensive evaluation:

```javascript
Score Components:
+ sources × 5000          (Most important!)
+ mineral_value × 100     (Strategic resources)
- distance × 500          (Closer is better)
+ 1000 if highway room    (Easier to defend)
- 2000 if center room     (SK rooms nearby)
+ 500 if corner/edge      (Controller position)
+ 2000 if adjacent        (Contiguous territory)
```

**Example Scores**:
- 3 sources, adjacent, highway: **17,500** (Excellent!)
- 2 sources, 3 away, normal: **9,500** (Good)
- 2 sources, 5 away, center: **5,500** (Meh)

#### B) Economy-Gated Expansion
New `findRoomToSupportClaiming()` function:
- Uses `canSupportExpansion()` from economy brain
- Only expands from rooms with HEALTHY+ status
- Selects richest room if multiple can support
- Falls back to 50k+ energy check if economy disabled

#### C) More Aggressive Claiming
- Spawns **2 nextroomers** (was 1) for faster setup
- Tracks expansion history in `Memory.expansionHistory`
- Better debug logging

#### D) Smarter Scout Spawning
- Only spawns scouts from economically healthy rooms
- Prevents wasting energy in struggling rooms

### 3. `/src/config.js` (UPDATED)
**Expansion Settings** - Much more aggressive:

```javascript
nextRoom: {
  scoutMinControllerLevel: 3,     // Start scouting at RCL 3 (was 4)
  intervalToCheck: 500,            // Check every 500 ticks (was ~600)
  maxRooms: 20,                    // Claim up to 20 rooms (was 8)
  cpuPerRoom: 12,                  // Optimized (was 13)
  maxDistance: 15,                 // Expand further (was 10)
  minNewRoomDistance: 1,           // Adjacent OK (was 2)
  minEnergyForActive: 500,         // Lower threshold (was 1000)
  notify: true,                    // Get notifications (was false)
  mineralValues: {                 // All increased 25-50%
    H: 20, O: 15, U: 20, K: 20, L: 20, Z: 20, X: 15
  },
  distanceFactor: 1.5,             // Less distance penalty (was 2)
}
```

**Debug Flag Added**:
```javascript
debug: {
  remoteMining: false,  // Enable to see remote mining assignments
}
```

### 4. `/src/brain_main.js` (INTEGRATION)
Added remote mining call:
```javascript
brain.manageRemoteMining();  // Runs after economy evaluation
```

### 5. `/src/require.js` (MODULE LOADING)
Added:
```javascript
require('./brain_remote_mining');
```

---

## How It Works

### Expansion Flow

```
Every 500 ticks:
  brain.handleNextroomer()
    ├─> Check if at GCL limit → STOP
    ├─> Check system resources (CPU/Memory/Heap) → STOP if low
    ├─> Find rooms that can support expansion (HEALTHY+ economy)
    ├─> Get list of claimable rooms (2+ sources, not occupied)
    │
    ├─> If claimable rooms found:
    │   ├─> Score all rooms using advanced algorithm
    │   ├─> Select highest scoring room
    │   ├─> Spawn claimer + 2 nextroomers
    │   └─> Track in Memory.expansionHistory
    │
    └─> If no claimable rooms found:
        └─> Spawn scouts from HEALTHY rooms to find new options
```

### Remote Mining Flow

```
Every 1000 ticks:
  brain.manageRemoteMining()
    └─> For each owned room:
        ├─> Check economy status (must be HEALTHY+)
        ├─> Find nearby unowned rooms with sources (within 3 distance)
        ├─> Score rooms: (sources × 1000) - (distance × 100)
        ├─> Assign top 2-3 rooms (3 if RCL 6+)
        └─> Store in Memory.remoteMining[roomName]
```

**Note**: Remote mining assignments are made, but you'll need to configure your existing sourcer/reserver spawning logic to use `Memory.remoteMining` data to actually send creeps.

## Key Improvements

### Expansion Quality
✅ **Smarter room selection** - Prioritizes adjacency, sources, strategic position
✅ **Economy-gated** - Only expands when rooms are economically ready
✅ **Better resource evaluation** - Higher value on needed minerals
✅ **Faster setup** - 2 nextroomers instead of 1

### Expansion Speed
✅ **More frequent checks** - Every 500 ticks (20% faster)
✅ **Lower thresholds** - Expands sooner (500 energy vs 1000)
✅ **Further reach** - Can claim rooms 15 tiles away
✅ **Adjacent rooms allowed** - Build contiguous empires

### Resource Acquisition
✅ **Remote mining system** - Automatically identifies profitable nearby rooms
✅ **Respects economy** - Only assigns when base is healthy
✅ **Scales with RCL** - More remotes at higher levels
✅ **Smart scoring** - Balances sources vs distance

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Deploy to server**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Enable debug logging**
   ```javascript
   // In src/config.js
   debug: {
     nextroomer: true,
     remoteMining: true,
     economy: true,
   }
   ```

3. **Monitor expansion attempts**
   - Console should show: `"handleNextroom - Checking for expansion opportunity"`
   - Every 500 ticks when under GCL limit

4. **Check Memory structures**
   ```javascript
   // In game console
   Memory.expansionHistory    // Should track past expansions
   Memory.remoteMining        // Should show assigned rooms per base
   ```

5. **Verify room scoring**
   - When claiming, check console for score values
   - Higher scores should be adjacent, 3-source rooms

6. **Test remote mining**
   - After 1000 ticks, check `Memory.remoteMining`
   - Should show 2-3 rooms per RCL 5+ base

### Expected Behavior:

✅ **Expansion triggers when:**
- Room has HEALTHY+ economy (50k+ energy)
- Below GCL limit
- Claimable rooms found by scouts
- System resources available (CPU, Memory, Heap)

✅ **Room selection prioritizes:**
- 3-source rooms over 2-source
- Adjacent rooms over distant
- Highway rooms over normal
- Strategic minerals (if needed)

✅ **Remote mining assigns:**
- 2 rooms at RCL 4-5
- 3 rooms at RCL 6+
- Only to HEALTHY+ rooms
- Within 3 tiles distance

✅ **Console output shows:**
```
[nextroomer] Claiming E15S25 from E15S24 (score: 17500)
[remoteMining] E15S24: Assigned 2 remote rooms: E16S24, E15S23
[economy] E15S24: HEALTHY | Income: 15.2/tick | Expand: true
```

## Success Metrics (Phase 2)

Track these over 20k ticks:

### Expansion Performance
- ✅ Bot claims new room within 10k ticks when economy is HEALTHY
- ✅ Room selection scores >10,000 (indicates quality targets)
- ✅ Expansion history tracked in Memory
- ✅ Claimer + 2 nextroomers spawn successfully

### Remote Mining
- ✅ Remote rooms assigned within 1000 ticks of RCL 5
- ✅ 2-3 remotes per base depending on RCL
- ✅ Assignments update every 1000 ticks
- ✅ Only assigned to HEALTHY+ rooms

### Economic Impact
- ✅ No expansion when rooms struggling (<HEALTHY)
- ✅ Scouts only spawn from healthy rooms
- ✅ New rooms reach RCL 3 within 15k ticks
- ✅ Remote mining increases total energy income

### System Stability
- ✅ No script errors in console
- ✅ CPU usage remains stable
- ✅ Memory usage grows linearly (expected)
- ✅ Bucket stays >5000

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Not expanding despite being under GCL
**Solutions**:
1. Check economy status: `Game.rooms['ROOM'].data.economy.status`
   - Must be HEALTHY or better
2. Check for claimable rooms: `Object.keys(global.data.rooms).filter(r => global.data.rooms[r].sources >= 2 && !Memory.myRooms.includes(r))`
3. Enable debug: `config.debug.nextroomer = true`

### Issue: Remote mining not assigning rooms
**Solutions**:
1. Check economy: Room must be HEALTHY+
2. Check RCL: Room should be 4+
3. Check distance: Remotes must be within 3 tiles
4. Check tick: Runs every 1000 ticks, be patient
5. Enable debug: `config.debug.remoteMining = true`

### Issue: Selecting bad rooms (far away, 2 sources)
**Solutions**:
1. Check if adjacent rooms available - they get +2000 bonus
2. Verify scout coverage - may not have seen good rooms yet
3. Wait longer - scouts need time to explore

### Issue: "No room can support expansion economically"
**Solutions**:
1. Check `room.data.economy.canExpand` - must be true
2. Verify storage >50k energy
3. Check income rate: `room.data.economy.income` should be positive
4. May need to wait for economy to improve

## Integration with Existing Systems

### How Remote Mining Data is Used

Your existing systems should check `Memory.remoteMining` to spawn creeps:

```javascript
// Example: In room execution logic
if (Memory.remoteMining[room.name]) {
  for (const remoteRoom of Memory.remoteMining[room.name]) {
    // Spawn sourcer for this remote room
    room.checkRoleToSpawn('sourcer', 2, sourceId, remoteRoom);
    // Spawn reserver
    room.checkRoleToSpawn('reserver', 1, controllerId, remoteRoom);
  }
}
```

**Note**: TooAngel may already have logic for external room harvesting. The `Memory.remoteMining` provides smart room selection, but actual spawning depends on existing external harvesting code.

## Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete! You can now:

### Option A: Test Phase 2 Thoroughly
- Deploy and monitor for 20k ticks
- Verify room claiming works
- Check remote mining assignments
- Tune thresholds if needed

### Option B: Proceed to Phase 3
- **Phase 3: Scout Detection & Elimination**
- Detect enemy scouts entering territory
- Auto-spawn defenders
- Kill scouts to maintain intelligence advantage
- Reputation penalties for scouting

### Quick Wins Before Phase 3:
1. **Monitor first expansion** - Watch it claim a new room
2. **Check remote assignments** - Verify smart room selection
3. **Tune config if needed**:
   - Increase `intervalToCheck` to 1000 for slower expansion
   - Decrease `maxRooms` to limit empire size
   - Adjust `maxDistance` to stay close to home

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Tuning Room Selection

Edit scoring weights in `brain_nextroom.js`:

```javascript
// Current weights:
score += data.sources * 5000;        // SOURCE PRIORITY
score += mineralValue * 100;         // Mineral value
score -= distance * 500;             // Distance penalty
score += adjacentToMine ? 2000 : 0;  // Adjacency bonus
score += isHighway ? 1000 : 0;       // Highway bonus
score -= isCenter ? 2000 : 0;        // Center penalty
```

**To prioritize different factors**:
- Want mineral diversity? Increase `mineralValue * 100` to `mineralValue * 500`
- Want tight empire? Increase `distance * 500` to `distance * 1000`
- Want max sources? Increase `sources * 5000` to `sources * 10000`

### Tuning Remote Mining

Edit in `brain_remote_mining.js`:

```javascript
// Change max distance (default 3)
const targets = findRemoteMiningTargets(baseRoom, 5);  // Expand to 5

// Change max remotes per base (default 2-3)
const maxRemotes = room.controller.level >= 6 ? 5 : 3;
```
